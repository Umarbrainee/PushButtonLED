This project demonstrates a simple **push button control system** using Arduino.  
It allows you to turn an LED or a buzzer on and off using a push button.

## How It Works
- When the push button is pressed, the LED or buzzer turns on.
- When the button is released, the LED or buzzer turns off.
- You can replace the LED with a buzzer to create a simple push button buzzer circuit.

## Features
- Simple push button interface for controlling an LED or buzzer.
- Ideal for beginners learning about digital input and output with Arduino.
- Fully customizable: you can change the connected pin or output device in the Arduino code.

## Purpose
This README provides an overview of the push button project.  
The main Arduino code in this repository controls the behavior of the LED or buzzer based on button presses.
